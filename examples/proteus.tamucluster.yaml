# This profile file controls your <#> (HashDist) build environment.

# This profile is written specific to the user srobertp.
# The parameters: section must be edited to reflect the 
# desired cmake and mpi to be used.  Since each user only
# has acces to their /u/name/ and /w/name/ accounts, you
# must change it to reflect your own personal account name.

# In the future, we'll provide better incorporation of
# automatic environment detection.  For now, have a look
# at the YAML files in the top-level directory and choose
# the most *specific* file that matches your environment.

- file: linux2.yaml

# The packages list specifies all the packages that you
# require installed.  <#> will ensure that all packages
# and their dependencies are installed when you build this
# profile.
