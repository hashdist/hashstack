# This is the reference implementation of Lapack from
# http://www.netlib.org/lapack/, written in Fortran. It doesn't have any
# machine specific optimizations (use openblas, host-lapack and similar
# packages for faster implementations).
#
# Note: if you use gfortran, define "compiler=gcc" in your yaml file in order
# for this recipe to use optimal compiler flags, which are crucial for
# good performance.
